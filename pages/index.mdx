# Welcome!

### Welcome to Whatscode.js Documentation!

Welcome to **whatscode.js** documentation! Here you'll find all the documentation you need to get up and running with the **whatscode.js**.

**Whatscode.js** is a package to create Whatsapp bots easily and quickly, even coding experience is not needed... Inspired by [Aoi.js](https://npmjs.com/aoi.js) which is a package for creating Discord bots with a syntax that is quite similar to **whatscode.js**!
