# $receivedQuotedImage

save the image that you quote/reply to the `tmp` folder and later can be processed into another function (its up to you). If the return path option is `no` then it will send the sticker back. Otherwise if `yes` then it will return the file path.

### Usage:

```plain
$receivedQuotedImage[return path? (yes/no)]
```
